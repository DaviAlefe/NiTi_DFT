  Post-processing - data analysis (mostly data cleaning) and data visualization - of DFT calculations of physical properties of Nitinol - a nickel and titanium alloy displaying shape memory effect - based on python data science standard libraries (mostly pandas and matplotlib).
  The DFT calculations are performed on the Quantum Espresso software.
